Documenting the process of this game's development over the course of 3 weeks.

This SHMUP remix is themed as a rescue operation for a bomb squad. A soldier accidentally stepped on a mine in the war zone, and you as the player are protecting a bomb squad and the soldier who stepped on the mine from enemy fire. The idea for this game origiated from the brain storming session on 9.21.2020 where we worked through a 3 stage ideation process. The first stage involved coming up with a word cloud for a SHMUP remix, among other ideas, some of the words that I came up with were "War", "Bomb Squad", "Survival", "Timer" which eventually lead to the development of this idea. From the word cloud, we further refined our ideas and came up with a further break down of competing ideas. Other ideas I had included a play on the movie Tenet, which involved a SHMUP with time inversion, where players catch bullets instead of shooting them and a spongebob themed SHMUP where you shoot krabby patties at hungry anchovies. Finally we ranked our ideas and picked the winning SHMUP remix theme, which for me was the War Zone themed rescue operation for a bomb-squad defuisng a mine on a mine field.

In this first commit, we made a simple SHMUP game by starting from the Breakout project, and modifying things on that project to make it work like a SHMUP, where we have enemies that shoot, and a player that can move and shoot enemies.

So far I've got the basic enemy spawning, shooting and gameplay working. The enemies are currently moving in the direction of the player, and the player's animations are working for walking, standing. While play testing, I realised that the game currently is not as challenging, as the bomb squad takes care of defusing and the player only needs to shoot. So I plan on changing this so that the player has to do everything - defusing the bomb, shooting enemies, healing themselves, etc. Another idea I want to try is introduce a barrier in the form of a vehicle or the like that helps the player get some time to defuse without worrying about getting shot. What would be interesting is to have the player repair this barrier if it gets damaged over time by taking in bullets.
