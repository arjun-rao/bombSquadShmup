# SHMUP Idea

My SHMUP remix is themed as a top down 2d view of a rescue operation for a bomb squad. A soldier accidentally stepped on a mine in the war zone, and you as the player are protecting a bomb squad and the soldier who stepped on the mine from enemy fire. 

## Fullerton's Formal Elements
I'm mainly focusing on "Objectives", "Procedures" and "Resources" as described below.

### Objectives

The main goal of my game is going to be to **rescue/survival** a bomb squad that is defusing a mine in a battle zone that has active enemy fire. So as the player the main objective is to 
prevent the bomb squad from getting killed by eliminating as many enemies as possible. If the bomb squad dies, the game ends and the player loses. 

Some additional secondary objectives include the following: 

* Eliminate as many enemies within the time it takes for the bomb squad to complete their defuse operation. 
* Kill-Streaks - Getting consecutive kills in short periods of time will lead to bonus points.
* Taking out enemy installations like Anti-Aircraft guns or tanks would give bonus points.

### Procedures

#### Starting Procedure
The game would begin with the player and bomb squad on one side, with a barrier setup in front of the bomb squad so that it protects them from direct fire. The Bomb Squad has a health bar and so does the armour. Once the armour gets hit, it's health reduces, and eventually gets destroyed. The player has to prevent enemies from destorying the armour and reducing the bomb squad health to zero by shooting them up before they can shoot down the bomb squad. 

#### Progression

The game difficulty increases as time goes on with different kinds of enemies being spawned. Things like armoured trucks with enemes in them, fast moving enemies, enemies with grenades - where the player needs to throw the grenade back to the enemy side before it blows up. etc.

#### Resolving Procedure

The game ends when the bomb squad successfully difuses the bomb, and theres a timer on the screen that counts down to how long this takes. There's also an enemy wave/count which shows how many enemy waves can be expected in a given level.

### Resources

The player has the following resources to work with: 
* Health (player health, bomb squad health)
* Armour (player armour, bomb squad armour)
* Kill streak bonuses - they can call in airdrops for armour/health if they get a kill streak
* Movable Barriers they can use to protect themselves or the bomb squad from enemy fire. 
* Additional weapons - more powerful guns with limited ammo they can use for a limited time. 


### Rules

The player cannot cross a certain threshold on the map, similarly enemies cannot enter the player's territory, while they can fire across the line of control/boundary. This is implemented as a long trench in the battle field. The main movements allowed for the player are moving in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and shooting. They also have the ability to use objects on the map using a separate action key - that can be used to throw grandes, open airdrops, etc.
