# SHMUP Idea

My SHMUP remix is themed as a rescue operation for a bomb squad. A soldier accidentally stepped on a mine in the war zone, and you as the player are protecting a bomb squad and the soldier who stepped on the mine from enemy fire. 

## Fullerton's Formal Elements
I'm mainly focusing on "Objectives", "Procedures" and "Resources" as described below.

### Objectives

The main goal of my game is going to be to **rescue** a bomb squad that is defusing a mine in a battle zone that has active enemy fire. So as the player the main objective is to 
prevent the bomb squad from getting killed by eliminating as many enemies as possible. If the bomb squad dies, the game ends and the player loses. 

Some additional secondary objectives include the following: 

* Eliminate as many enemies within the time it takes for the bomb squad to complete their defuse operation. 
* Kill-Streaks - Getting consecutive kills in short periods of time will lead to bonus points.
* Taking out enemy installations like Anti-Aircraft guns or tanks would give bonus points.
